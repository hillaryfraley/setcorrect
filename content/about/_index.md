My name is Hillary, and I'm a technical writer and editor. Ever since I wrote a manual in my first job, I've enjoyed creating documentation that solves problems and helps people succeed.

![This is me][1]

You can see some examples of my work in [my portfolio](https://www.setcorrect.com). Check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hillaryfraley) for more information about my background or [my GitHub](https://github.com/hillaryfraley) to see what I'm working on.

Are you wondering what `setcorrect` might mean? It's just the name of my freelancing LLC: SETCorrect.

If you're a fellow technical writer, let's connect! I love this job, and I'm always happy to meet other people who are doing it too.
