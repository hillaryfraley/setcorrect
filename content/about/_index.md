My name is Hillary, and I'm a technical writer and editor. Ever since I wrote an employee manual in my first job, I've been fascinated with how documentation can solve problems and make things easier for people.

![This is me][1]

I do project-based work on everything from API documentation to presentation decks.

You can see some examples of my work in [my portfolio](https://www.setcorrect.com). Check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hillaryfraley) for more information about my background or [my GitHub](https://github.com/hillaryfraley) to see a few of the things I'm working on.

And if you're a fellow technical writer, let's connect! I love this job, and I'm always excited to meet other people who are doing it too.
