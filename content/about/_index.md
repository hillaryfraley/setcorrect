My name is Hillary, and I'm a technical writer and editor. Ever since I wrote an employee manual in my first job, I've been fascinated with how documentation can solve problems and make things easier for people.

![This is me][1]

I do project-based work on everything from API documentation to presentation decks.

Documentation is a company asset. Your docs are just like any other asset: employees, platforms, code, offices, and trade formulas. They are vital to your business! If you aren't treating your documentation like an asset, I can help you.

You can see some of my work samples in [my portfolio](/portfolio/). Check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hillaryfraley) for more information about my background.

And if you're a fellow technical writer, [let's connect](/contact/)! I love this job, and I'm always excited to meet other people who are doing it too.
