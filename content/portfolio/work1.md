I worked with Typeform's developers and managers to document three APIs and one SDK.
<!--more-->

[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) helps users create beautiful, conversational online forms. The Typeform platform includes APIs for creating and updating typeforms, programmatically retrieving typeform responses, and pushing responses to URLs and web apps. Typeform also supports an SDK for seamlessly embedding typeforms in websites and web apps.

I was hired to create documentation for a developer portal that would help developers quickly feel at home with Typeform's platform and start using it to create customized solutions for their own teams. I worked with Typeform's developers and product managers to document three APIs and one SDK.

### Work examples

The developer portal is published at [https://www.typeform.com/developers/](https://www.typeform.com/developers/). Some pages have been updated since I worked on them, but these examples show my work:

OpenAPI Specification files were available as source material for the API documentation. I worked closely with Typeform's developers and product managers to gather information and validate my drafts. To test endpoints and confirm request bodies and responses, I used Postman and cURL. I wrote the content in Markdown, and all of the documentation files were hosted on GitHub.

### Portal site

The docs were deployed to a Gatsby site designed and built by Typeform's talented designers and developers. Seriously, the site they put together is **gorgeous**: [https://www.typeform.com/developers/](https://www.typeform.com/developers/). I helped review wireframe designs for the portal site, but I did not design or implement it.
