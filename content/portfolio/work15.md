In 2016, I learned about Jekyll and spent **a lot** of time reading Molly Ivins.

<!--more-->

Then I took a [Lynda.com course on Jekyll](https://www.lynda.com/Jekyll-tutorials/Jekyll-Web-Designers/383124-2.html) and spent **way more** time scouring the web for obituaries written by Molly Ivins.

I picked my favorite passages from each one, documented every source I could find for them, and made a Jekyll blog that I love.

* [Obituaries by Molly Ivins](https://hillaryfraley.github.io/obits-by-molly-ivins/) (link to GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll blog)
* [GitHub repo for the project](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins) (link to one of my GitHub repositories)

If you know of an obituary I missed, please [let me know](/contact/)!
