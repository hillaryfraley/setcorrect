In 2016, I learned of static site generators and spent **a lot** of time reading the late, great [Molly Ivins](https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2007-02-01/obituary-for-molly-ivins/).

Then I took an online course to learn more about Jekyll and spent **way more** time scouring the web for obituaries written by Molly Ivins. I picked my favorite passage from each one, documented every source I could find, and made a Jekyll site.

* [Obituaries by Molly Ivins](https://hillaryfraley.github.io/obits-by-molly-ivins/) (link to GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll site)
* [GitHub repo for the project](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins) (link to one of my GitHub repositories)

If you know of an obituary I missed, please let me know! Email me at hillary@setcorrect.com or [create a PR](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins).
