When I worked at [BioScience Writers](http://www.biosciencewriters.com), I wrote articles to help researchers improve their scientific manuscripts and build rapport with potential clients.

I wrote the articles in Microsoft Word, and our web developer published them in HTML on the company website. All of the articles I wrote were reviewed and edited by my wonderful colleagues at the company.

Some of the articles grew out of common issues that my coworkers and I noticed as we reviewed and quality-checked 30+ editing orders each week. Here are two examples:

* [Top 10 Basic Errors BioScience Writers Corrects in Scientific Manuscripts](http://www.biosciencewriters.com/Top-10-Basic-Errors-BioScience-Writers-Corrects-in-Scientific-Manuscripts.aspx)
* [Top 10 Good Habits in Scientific Writing](http://www.biosciencewriters.com/Top-10-Good-Habits-in-Scientific-Writing.aspx)

Some of the articles were inspired by questions people asked our company president during her popular scientific writing workshops. For these articles, I used her workshop slides and notes as source material and supplemented with my own research. Here are two examples:

* [Impact Factors and Your Scientific Manuscript](http://www.biosciencewriters.com/Impact-Factors-and-Your-Scientific-Manuscript.aspx)
* [Writing Strong Titles for Research Manuscripts](http://www.biosciencewriters.com/Writing-Strong-Titles-for-Research-Manuscripts.aspx)

#### Tools
