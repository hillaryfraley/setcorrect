I worked with API consultant [James Higginbotham](https://twitter.com/launchany) to create this fill-in-the-blanks template for minimum API documentation.
<!--more-->

We wanted to offer a solution for developers who need API docs but don't have a technical writer or documentarian available to handle it.

With this template, developers can clone the repo and update the placeholder text with information about their API. Our idea was that when you've replaced all the placeholder text, you'll have the essentials documented well enough to help people use your API!

We also wrote a README.md for the project with details about how to clone, which files to update, and specs for images, among other things:
