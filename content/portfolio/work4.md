I worked with another technical writer to create user guides for logging-while-drilling (LWD) software.
<!--more-->

The users were manufacturing technicians who installed and programmed the LWD software and associated equipment. My work included writing, developmental/substantive editing, and applying the company style guide. For this example, I moved the content to MadCap Flare and added custom CSS to style the text and control image size.

This sample is from the user guide for programming the LWD data transmission system. The Introduction, Warnings, and three FPGA topics are active, along with the Glossary. To maintain confidentiality, I rewrote some of the steps, blurred the screenshots, and removed the PIC and DataFlash/NAND topics.
