This is example API documentation that I put together as I worked through [Tom Johnson's terrific course on documenting REST APIs](http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_course_overview/).

* [Example API documentation in Whiteboard](/samples/surfreport/index.html) (.html)

The basis for this documentation is [this fictional wiki](http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_new_endpoint_to_doc/). I wanted to try a simple tri-pane tool, so I used [Whiteboard](https://github.com/mpociot/whiteboard) to generate a neat and organized API doc set with code samples.

Whiteboard is a Node.js-based API docs generator that uses Markdown files to render the documentation. I originally wanted to use [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), but I had trouble with the convoluted setup process that Whiteboard's creator mentions in the [project README.md](https://github.com/mpociot/whiteboard/blob/master/README.md).

If you're curious, here's the same doc set as a [GitHub wiki written in rST](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/surfreport-apiexample/wiki) (link to one of my GitHub repositories).
