I write Zendesk help docs to support Pleexy's users.

<!--more-->

[Pleexy](http://pleexy.com) boosts your productivity by integrating tasks from email, collaboration, and task-tracking services into your task manager (Todoist or Wunderlist).

I write Zendesk documentation to help people [get started](https://help.pleexy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002388587-1-How-Pleexy-Works) with using Pleexy, [integrate their tasks](https://help.pleexy.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000526208-Integrations) from different productivity services, and find their way around the [Pleexy dashboard](https://help.pleexy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009556967-Main-dashboard).

I also add screenshots and animated GIFs to the docs as needed to illustrate written processes.
